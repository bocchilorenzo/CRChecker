# CRChecker
## Description
CRChecker is a simple Python script that checks if the CRC hashes of the FLAC files in a directory match those reported in the log file generated by Exact Audio Copy.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher
* On Linux and Mac OS, make sure to have the `flac` library installed
* Requirements listed in `requirements.txt` (install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## Basic usage
```bash
python crchecker.py -p <directory> [-s]
```

## Options
* `-p <directory>`: Path to the directory containing the FLAC files and the log file
* `-s`: If specified, the script will save the report in the folder containing the FLAC files. Otherwise, the report will only be printed to the console.

## Limitations
* It only works with log files generated by Exact Audio Copy
* It only works with FLAC files
* It only reads the 'Copy CRC' hashes in the log file
* The log file must be in English
